			<p>Mountain Dew is a carbonated soft drink brand produced and owned by PepsiCo.
			The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman.
			A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958.
			The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia.
			William H. "Bill" Jones of the Tip corporation further refined the formula,
			launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961.On August 27, 1964,
			the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company,
			at which point distribution expanded more widely across the United States and Canada.</p>
